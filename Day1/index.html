            <h2>Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas</h2>
            <p>Narendra Damodardas Modi born 17 September 1950 is an
                Indian politician who has served as the 14th prime minister of India since May 2014. Modi was the Chief
                Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member
                of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a far right Hindu
                nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister from outside
                the Indian National Congress.

                Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary
                education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. His account of helping his father sell tea
                at the Vadnagar railway station has not been reliably corroborated.
